<h1> Tango Assessment</h1>
<p>
 	Mathematically, we hypothesized the result is the contestant switching their original choice will result a double chance to win the price, and the paradigm of solving is do a paradigm shift to think the game process reversely. Base on that, a simulation was built to imitate the game, and play the game 2000 times and analyze the result.

<p>	
	In the simulation, the input data of each game is the winning briefcase, the contestantâ€™s original choice and do they choose to switch. An exclusive or logic (XOR) is performed in the game checking process. From the simulation, we obtain the winning rate of the contestant chose switch is 68.1%, and the winning rate of staying is 33.8%. The ratio of these rates is approximately 1:2. Also, the simulation provides the cumulative winning rate, which is 51%, close to a half, shows the game is fair, and the algorithm is preformed correctly. This program also provides a visualization of the results by plotting them into a choice vs. winning rate bar chart. and 3 pie charts for the winning rates.

<p>
	The result of the simulation matches the mathematical hypothesis,  explicitly shows switch the original choice will result a double probability to win. This program is also friendly to add more features to the current specifications, by modifying the constants, and change the data type of the parameters, specifically, a boolean to an integer.
